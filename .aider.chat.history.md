#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Football game  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

To update the app’s title, description, and generate a logo you’ll need to edit the metadata file and create a new logo‑generation todo file.

**Files that need to be edited or added**

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the exported `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to describe the logo image that should be generated.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE block for it. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A vibrant football stadium scene with a packed crowd, bright lights, and a football in the center of the field. The background shows a stadium roof with banners, a scoreboard, and a clear night sky with stars. The image should convey excitement and energy of a football match.
